# Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose
+ Describes the purpose of the SRS
+ Specifies the intended audience for the SRS

The purpose of this document is to present a detailed descriptio of a school managemet system. It will explain the functionalities and features of the system, the interfaces of the system, what the system shall do y the costraints in which under the system will work.

This document will provide all the stakeholders that are involved in the school employees and students enrollment process a high-level statement of the functionalities of the system.
## 1.2 Scope
+ Identify the software products to be produced by name
+ Explain what the software products, will and will not do
+ Describes the application of the software being specified, includes benefits, objectives and goals

This management software will be a CRUD system for an elementary school located in the south-eastern part of the city. This system is designed to ease the control process of students and employees at the institution. In a more specific level, for both students and employee, the system will provide the manager the capability of register their information, update the registered members information, and remove from the system students and employees who no longer are part of the school. 
## 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations
+ Provides the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required properly to interpret the SRS
## 1.4 References
+ Identifies each document by title, repor number, date, and publishing organizations
+ Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained
## 1.5 Overview
+ Describes what the rest of the SRS contains
+ Explains how the SRS is organized

This document contains the difficulties that the elementary school is going through because of the lack of a computer system that can help them have control over the register of employees and students that are part of the institution. It also displays the needs and wants of the stakeholders that were identified during the specification process.

As for the next chapter, it contains a general view of the functionality of the product. It describes the requirements in a high-level way and it stablishes a connection for the technical requirements specification in the next chapter.

The third chapter is written for stakeholders with more technical aknowledgement because it describes the functionality of the product in technical terms.

# Overall Description
+ Describes the general factors that affect the product and it requirements. This section dos not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides background for those requirements.


## 2.1 Product perspective
+ This subsection of hte SRS should put the product into perspective with other related products. 
  If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here. 
  If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, as frequently occurs, then
  this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software
  and should indentify interfaces between that system and the software.
  
+ This subsection should also describe how the software operates insides various constraints. For example, these constraints could include.

### 2.1.1 System Interfaces
+ This should list each system interface and identify the functionality of the software to accomplish the system requirement
  and the interface description to match the system.
### 2.1.2 User interfaces
+ This should specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users.
+ All the aspects of optimizing the interface with the person who must use the system.

### 2.1.3 Hardware interfaces
+ This should specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software products and the hardware
  component of the system.
### 2.1.4 Software interfaces
+ This should specify the use of other required software products and interfaces with other applications systems.

### 2.1.5 Communication interfaces
+ This should specify the various interfaces to communication such as local network protocols, etc.
### 2.1.6 Memory
+ This should specify any applicable characteristics and limits on primary and secondary memory.

### 2.1.7 Operations
+ This should specify the normal and special operations required by the user such as:
+ The various nodes of operations in the user organization.

### 2.1.8 Site adaption requirements
+ This should define the requirements for any data or initialization sequences that are specific to a given site, mission, or operational mode.
## 2.2 Product functions
+ This subsection of the SRS should provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform.
## 2.3 User characteristics
+ This subsection of the SRS should describe those general characteristics of the intender users of the product including educational level, experience, and technical expertise.

## 2.4 Constraints
+ This subsection of the SRS should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer's options
## 2.5 Assumptions and dependencies
This subsection of the SRS should list each of the factor that affect the requirements stated in the SRS.

# Specific Requirements
+ This section of the SRS should contain all of the software requirements to a leve of detail sufficient to enable desginers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers
  to test that the system satisfies those requirements.
