## 1.5 Overview
This document contains the difficulties that the elementary school is going through because of the lack of a computer system that can help them have control over the register of employees and students that are part of the institution. It also displays the needs and wants of the stakeholders that were identified during the specification process.

As for the next chapter, it contains a general view of the functionality of the product. It describes the requirements in a high-level way and it establishes a connection for the technical requirements specification in the next chapter.
The third chapter is written for stakeholders with more technical acknowledgement because it describes the functionality of the product in technical terms.
